# Waste Segregation System using Arduino ♻️

## 📌 Project Overview
This is my **Final Year ECE Project** on **Automatic Waste Segregation**.  
The system uses **Arduino UNO** and sensors to detect and segregate waste into different bins (e.g., metal, wet, and dry waste).  
It aims to promote **smart waste management** and reduce manual effort.

## ⚡ Features
- Segregates waste into different categories (metal / wet / dry).
- Uses **sensors** (IR, Moisture, Metal Detector, Ultrasonic).
- Automatic operation with servo/motor-controlled bins.
- Low-cost and scalable solution for smart cities.

## 🛠️ Components Used
- Arduino UNO (or compatible board)
- IR Sensor
- Moisture Sensor
- Metal Detector Sensor
- Ultrasonic Sensor
- Servo Motors
- LCD Display (16x2)
- Power Supply
- Connecting Wires & Breadboard
- Waste bins

## 💻 Arduino Code
The main code is in the file:  
[`waste_segregation.ino`](waste_segregation.ino)

---

## 🚀 Working Principle
1. Waste is dropped into the system.
2. Sensors detect the type of waste:
   - **Metal sensor** → metal waste.
   - **Moisture sensor** → wet waste.
   - **IR sensor** → dry waste.
3. Arduino processes the data and rotates a servo/motor to direct waste into the correct bin.
